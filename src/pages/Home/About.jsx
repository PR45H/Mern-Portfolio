                        ðŸš€ Transforming from number cruncher to tech enthusiast! Hi there,
                        I'm Prashant Babu, a number-savvy professional with an
                        unconventional tech journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in the school days, I was the "go-to guy" for fixing tech
                        glitches, but being in a middle-class family meant IT dreams took a
                        backseat. I embraced commerce studies, earning my stripes with an
                        M.Com in Business Economics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast-forward to today, I'm weaving my tech dreams into reality! By
                        day, I delve into the intricate world of accounting and wealth
                        management. But my heart races with lines of code. I'm on a quest to
                        become a tech maestro, currently diving headfirst into the Full
                        Stack Web Development course at Masai, certified through Prepleaf by
                        Masai.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ðŸŒŸ My tech journey is just beginning, and I'm excited to explore the
                        endless possibilities. I'm on the lookout for a dynamic team to
                        collaborate with, where I can contribute my skills and learn from
                        the best. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
